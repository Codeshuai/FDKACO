		@comment The following triples <API1, r, API2> indicate the relation between APIs. API1 and API2 represent two different Java APIs, and r represents the relation that exists between them. And the basis text for the existence of each API relation are also be given.
		<java.util.stream.Stream.forEach, Efficiency comparison, java.util.stream.Stream.map>: About performance, "map" really wins over "forEach" if you use parallelStreams;
		<java.util.stream.Stream.stream, Efficiency comparison, org.eclipse.collections.impl.factory.Lists.collectIf>: Eclipse Collections' collectIf() method allows a single call to deal with both filtering and transformation. It evaluates eagerly and should be a bit faster than using a Stream;
		<java.util.stream.Stream.forEach, Behavioral difference, java.util.stream.Stream.forEachOrdered>: Parallel without nulls and filter (so the stream is SIZED): toArrays has the best performance in such case, and .forEach() fails with "indexOutOfBounds" on the recepient ArrayList, had to replace with .forEachOrdered();

			1.Think about whether the API usage in the code snippet can be optimized;
			2. Optimize the API usages in code snippets by referring to all API relations, specific rules can be found in the "API Relation Reference Method";
			3.Modify the code directly and provide a detailed explanation of the optimizations along with the modified code;
			4.List three possible optimizations;
